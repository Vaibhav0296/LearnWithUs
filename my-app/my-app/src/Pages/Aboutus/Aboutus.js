							<h2 className='text-muted'>Why E-Learning</h2>
							<br />
							<p className="text-justify">eLearning is more flexible and simple than the traditional chalk-and-board techniques of teaching. Many students have also admired it because of its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Students can continue their learning process around other responsibilities and commitments through multimedia content and online resources anytime that is convenient for them. eLearning is also well-suited for companies who wish to further train their employees because of the increasing amount of technological advancements. It is also convenient because eLearning is suitable for companies with a limited budget. They can enroll their employees in different eLearning programs to enhance their learning. Students who are more serious and responsible about their studies are more likely to take the online courses of their choice to build their educational careers</p>
